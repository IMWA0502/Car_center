   <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
   <p class="paragrafo1">Please read the following Terms & Conditions very carefully. We are friendly, polite, and will always try to be as helpful as humanly possible. Time is precious — our Terms & <br>Conditions are set up not 
    to waste yours. So please take the time to read all advert descriptions for our vehicles.</p>
<hr>
<h2>DEPOSIT</h2>
<p class="paragrafo1">We require a <b>£200 deposit</b>, which is <b>non-refundable</b> unless in the event of a <b>major mechanical issue</b> on collection or delivery. <br>
This can be paid via <b>bank transfer</b> or over the <b>phone</b> (our office number is available in the Contact section of our website or at the bottom of any webpage). <br>
If you fail to do this, we cannot guarantee to hold the car for you. <br>


<b>Important:</b> <br>
Please <b>do not assume</b> the car will be in stock. <b>Call us before visiting</b> to confirm availability of the vehicle.</p>

<hr>

<h2>WHAT TO EXPECT & HOW THE WHOLE PROCEDURE WORKS</h2>
<p class="paragrafo1">Any viewer may <b>test drive</b> and <b>inspect the vehicle</b> before deciding whether to proceed. <br>
If you have not purchased a second-hand car before, we <b>advise bringing someone experienced</b> who can help you know what to look for. <br>

Please remember: <br>
All our vehicles are <b>second-hand</b> and will not be in perfect condition. <br>
If you are not satisfied with the vehicle after viewing and testing, you are under <b> no obligation  to proceed</b> with the purchase. <br>

One of our friendly sales team members will accompany you on the test drive for <b>valid insurance purposes.</b></p>

<hr>
<h2>EXTERIOR</h2>
<p class="paragrafo1">Please expect to see <b> marks and imperfections</b> on the bodywork and alloys <b>commensurate with age and mileage.</b> <br>
We always upload <b>high-definition photos</b>, so please take the time to <b>view them carefully,</b> as we cannot describe all visible marks. <br>

It is common for used cars to have had <b>historical repair or paintwork</b>, so some evidence of this may be present. <br>

<b>All our vehicles are HPI clear of accident damage,</b> unless otherwise stated in the vehicle listing. <br>
</p>

<hr>
<h2>INTERIOR</h2>
<p class="paragrafo1">Similarly, please expect to see <b>marks and imperfections</b> that are <b>consistent with age and mileage.</b></p>

<hr>
<h2>DRIVE</h2>
<p class="paragrafo1">Please remember this is a <b>second-hand vehicle</b> and it will <b>drive accordingly.</b> <br>
Parts do wear out, and you may need to renew or replace some over time. <br>

Typical items that may require attention include:</p> <br>
<ul class="paragrafo1">
<li>Tyres</li>
<li>Flywheel / Clutch</li>
<li>Brake pads / Discs</li>
<li>Ball joints / Top mounts</li>
<li>Wheel bearings</li>
<li>Bushes</li>
<li>Chips or cracks in the windscreen</li>
<li>Electrical items</li>
<li>Warning lights on the dashboard</li>
</ul>
<p class="paragrafo1">There are many electrical components in modern vehicles, and unfortunately, <b>we do not have the time to test them all.</b> <br>
Some features that <b>may not be fully functional</b> include: </p> <br>
<ul class="paragrafo1">
<li>Parking sensors</li>
<li>Air conditioning</li>
<li>Electric windows, etc.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>TO SUMMARISE</h2>
<p class="paragrafo1">We hope it is clear and understandable that, as a <b>second-hand item</b>, the vehicle may <b>require further money</b> to be spent on it due to its <b>age, mileage, and the price paid.</b> <br>

If you are not satisfied with the vehicle, <b>you do not have to proceed.</b> <br>

We always aim to disclose any <b>obvious known issues</b>, but due to time limitations, <b>we cannot guarantee the vehicle is fault-free.</b> <br>

As mentioned, you are welcome to <b>check the vehicle however you see fit</b> during our opening hours. We recommend arriving early to allow time for thorough inspection.</p>

<hr>
<h2>DELIVERY</h2>
<p class="paragrafo1">We can arrange delivery or put you in touch with our trusted partners for <b>cost-effective delivery.</b> <br>
Please email or call if you require this service.</p>

<hr>

<h2>PART EXCHANGE</h2>
